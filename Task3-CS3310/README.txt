Task #3


In these programs, the user will be asked to enter a size of integers and the program will begin to do its multiplication. However, the user can only input a number thats a power of 2, for an example n, or the dimensions/size can only be 2,4,8,16,32,64.. etc. Depending on the User’s memory, the program will only be able to handle a specific size for the dimensions, and will execute the multiplication in either the Classical/traditional method or in Strassen’s Method.
